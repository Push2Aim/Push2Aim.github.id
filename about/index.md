# FAQs

## Why did you start your company?
In our genes, we're entrepreneurs and creatives (in real world to-be entrepreneurs). We're obsessed with  the vision to positively impact as many people as possible - to make them happy for reaching goals.
We strongly feel that we couldn't do anything else except for doing our own thing.

## How did your team come together?
Timo and Johannes were part of Summer School by Burda, were you learn all kinds of startup basic within the tight schedule of 2 weeks. Was great fun, we got along greatly, and wanted to continue working together.

Another note on our team:
We're 2 co-founders - Johannes and Timo. But there are a couple of part-time volunteers workers or team members whose future roles is unclear:
- Roman Busse, product development advisor
- Patrick Müller, business advisor
- André Wehr, traction advisor
- Sofia Hopf, corporate design and branding
- Ege Özsoy, camera and code (learning ML & AI)

We very very grateful that they passionately working with us, and time will show their role and involvement.
